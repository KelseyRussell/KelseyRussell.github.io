    <h2>About the African Penguin</h2>
    <p>The African Penguin <em>(Sphenicus demersus) is also know as the Cape or South African penguin and they live in southern African waters. They are flightless and weigh around 3 kilograms.</em></p>
    <p>Distinctive features include a pink patch above the eye and a black mask.</p>
    <p>They mostly feed on fish and squid. They are currently considered endangered because of several threats. </p>

    <h2>Distribution and Habitat</h2>
    <p>They are only found along the Southwestern coast of Africa, living in colonies along the coast between South Africa and Namibia. Two colonies were established in the 1980s in Cape Town. These are Boulder's Beach and Betty's Bay. Mainland colonies such as these are only possible recently because of a reduced number of predators. </p>
    <h3>Population</h3>
    <p>4 million African penguins existed in the beginning of the 19th century, in the 20th century only 10% remain.</p>
    <p>In 2008, 5,000 breeding pairs were estimated to live in Namibia. The African penguin is predicted to be extinct in the wild by 2026. </p>

    <h2>Behavior</h2>
    <h3>Diet</h3>
    <p>African penguins forage in the open sea. They typically swim within 20km of the shore. They may consume up to 540 grams of prey everyday.</p>
    <p>Due to less sardines living in the water, African penguin's diet has shifted to anchovies, which is not ideal because of their lower composition of fat and proteins. As with many birds, diet choice correlates with breeding success, making the reduced population of sardines detrimental to the African penguin population. </p>
    <h3>Breeding</h3>
    <p>African penguins are monogomous.Breeding season in South Africa is March-May and in Namibia it is November-December. A clutch of two eggs are burried under boulders or in sand. Parents take turns gaurding the chick for around a month at a time. Thereafter, the chick joins a chreche of other chicks so that the parents can spend their day foraging in the sea.</p>
    <h3>Predation</h3>
    <p>The average lifespan is 10-25 years in the wild and 30 in captivity. Their main predators are sharks and fur seals.</p>

    <h2>Threats and Conservation</h2>
    <h3>Historical Exploitation</h3>
    <p>African penguin eggs were considered a delicacy until the 1970s and were being sold in local towns. In the 1950s, they grew in popularity because French cooking recipes called for African penguin eggs.</p>
    <h3>Oil Spills</h3>
    <p>Penguins are susceptible to pollution of their habitat through petrochemicals. </p>
    <p>In 1948, the tanker <em>Esso Wheeling</em> sank, resulting in the death of thousands of penguins.</p>
    <p>In 1979, an oil spill prompted the collection and treatment of 150 penguins. They were re-released on Robbin Island and swam back to their respective colonies.</p>
    <p>In 1983, more penguins were exposed to an oil spill. 10,000 penguins were collected and only half of them survived.</p>
    <h3>Conservation Status</h3>
    <p>In September of 2010, it was listed as endangered under the US Endangered Species Act. As of 2018, they are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List. It's population is approximately 50,000 birds and declining.</p>

    <h2>Captivity</h2>
    <p>African penguins are commonly seen in zoos around the world. They adapt fairly well to the captive environment, and are often kept outside since they do not require cold temperatures.</p>
    <p>Between 2010 and 2013, American zoos spend $300,000 on African penguin conservation.</p>
